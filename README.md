# DISCONTINUED:
Turns out the submodule idea causes more pain than good; this has been moved back into [EnderIO-Rewrite](https://github.com/Rover656/EnderIO-Rewrite).

# EnderIO-Art
This is a repository for storing the art assets for EnderIO, allowing us to separate code and assets during the rewrite.

## Submitting your assets
To submit your assets, first fork the PR and create a new branch to work from; perform your artistic feat, then add your name and declare that your assets are released under the CC0 1.0 license (see below) in CONTRIBUTORS.md.

Do what you want with it, as long as you smile while doing so. While it is not a requirement, it would be nice to know if it is being used and how, so send me hello to **crazypants.mc at gmail.com**.
